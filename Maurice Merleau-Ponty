Maurice Merleau-Ponty was reading a book by Edmund Hussler titled "The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology."
Maurice Merleau-Ponty learned the philosophy of Hussler about phenomenology as a science of consciousness rather than of empirical things and transcendental-idealist philosophy.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty then discovered rationalism and empiricism. He contradicted rationalism, as it elevates the significance of the mind and perception too much.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty contradicted empiricism, as it negates the mind and perception and focuses on the body's senses.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty thinks Hussler's idea is that the mental and physical aspects of who we are are completely woven together. With this idea, Merleau-Ponty was convinced that the mind and body were intertwined. He stated that the self is embodied subjectivity.
